Abstract —We present Whole-Body Mobile Manipulation Inter-
face (HoMMI), a data collection and policy learning framework
that learns whole-body mobile manipulation directly from robot-
free human demonstrations. We augment UMI interfaces with
egocentric sensing to capture the global context required for
mobile manipulation, enabling portable, robot-free, and scalable
data collection. However, naively incorporating egocentric sensing
introduces a larger human-to-robot embodiment gap in both
observation and action spaces, making policy transfer difficult.
We explicitly bridge this gap with a cross-embodiment hand-eye
policy design, including an embodiment agnostic visual represen-
tation; a relaxed head action representation; and a whole-body
controller that realizes hand-eye trajectories through coordinated
whole-body motion under robot-specific physical constraints.
Together, these enable long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks
requiring bimanual and whole-body coordination, navigation,
and active perception.

I. I NTRODUCTION

Achieving generalizable and effective mobile manipulation
requires seamless whole-body coordination , which consists
of coordinating diverse sensory inputs (e.g., egocentric head-
mounted cameras to eye-in-hand wrist cameras) and complex
action spaces (e.g., between the arms, torso, head, and base
movements). Manually programming such intricate coordina-
tion for the vast variety of real-world tasks is prohibitively
difficult, making learning from human a promising alternative.
However, existing human demonstration paradigms mostly
rely on robot teleoperation, which is expensive, slow, and
unintuitive to deploy for mobile manipulators across diverse
real-world settings. Handheld data collection devices such as
UMI [ 5 ] offer a more scalable solution. They essentially learn
end-effector motions through handheld grippers with wrist-
mounted camera observations, allowing portable and robot-

free demonstration collection. However, wrist-centric sensing
provides only local views around the end-effectors and often
under-observes the global context needed for navigation, bi-
manual coordination, and task progress tracking.
Adding an egocentric view (i.e., head-mounted camera) is
a natural solution to fill this gap. By capturing the broader
workspace, the spatial relationship between hands, as well as
humans’ active perception behaviors, egocentric views provide
critical information that wrist cameras lack. However, naively
incorporating egocentric sensing into UMI framework intro-
duces a larger human-to-robot embodiment gap , including:

• Visual gap: Human and robot arms differ in appearance,
and egocentric viewpoints vary due to height discrepancies
between human and robot embodiments.

• Kinematic gap: Humans and robots differ in body morphol-
ogy and neck degrees of freedom. Directly regressing and
tracking both hands and head 6-DoF trajectories often yield
infeasible robot motions.
As a result, prior egocentric systems either rely on additional
teleoperation data for action grounding [ 16 , 49 ], or restrict
the application domain to fixed-base bimanual manipulation
without whole-body coordination [ 45 , 43 ]. This paper aims
to scale mobile manipulation learning by augmenting the
UMI framework with egocentric observation, while explicitly
bridging the embodiment gap. Our system highlights the
following key technical contributions:

• HoMMI Data Collection System: We extend the bimanual
UMI framework with a head-mounted camera. By inte-
grating the iPhone ARKit, the system enables synchronous
capture of multi-view video and 6-DoF poses within a
unified and globally consistent coordinate frame.

• Embodiment-Agnostic Vision Representations: To bridge
the observation gap, we use a 3D visual representation for
egocentric observations. This allows us to use embodiment-
agnostic coordinate frames (i.e., end-effector frame), and
remove embodiment-specific observations (e.g., demonstra-
tor’s arms and body), mitigating appearance and viewpoint
mismatches.

• Relaxed Head Action Representation: Since our egocen-
tric representation is view-agnostic, we represent the robot
gaze as a “3D look-at point” to bridge the kinematic gap.
Compared with directly copying the 6-DoF head poses
from humans, which is often kinematically incompatible
with robot hardware, this relaxed action representation
enables effective transfer of active perception strategies to
robots with disparate heights and joint constraints, without
sacrificing the tracking accuracy of end-effectors.

• Constraint-Aware Whole-Body Control: We design a
whole-body controller that can coordinate whole-body mo-
tions to precisely track end-effector trajectories for accurate
manipulation, while respecting the unique constraints in a
bimanual mobile robot system for stable and safe motions.
Together, these ideas enable a scalable, in-the-wild human
demonstration collection that is directly transferable to real
robots. We demonstrate that our system achieves precise,

long-horizon, and spatially complex whole-body mobile ma-
nipulation tasks, including active search, manipulation, and
navigation across large workspaces.

II. R ELATED W ORK
A. Data Collection Interfaces for Robot Learning
Robot learning from demonstrations traditionally relies on
teleoperation [ 34 , 38 , 40 , 36 , 4 ], which yields robot-native data
with minimal embodiment gap but is slow, costly, and difficult
to deploy for mobile manipulators in diverse environments.
UMI [ 5 , 47 ] addresses scalability by enabling in-the-wild data
collection with a portable handheld system. While UMI min-
imizes the embodiment gap by using wrist-mounted cameras
and relative end-effector control, its reliance on wrist-centric
sensing fundamentally limits the observability of the global
task context. Recent UMI extensions incorporate an external
camera [ 26 ] or VR headsets [ 45 , 43 ], but their stationary
setups or motion sickness limit their application to fixed-base
tasks. In contrast, HoMMI integrates a non-intrusive head-
mounted camera into the UMI framework, enabling seamless
and scalable deployment in dynamic mobile environments.

B. Robot Learning from Egocentric Demonstrations
Egocentric human demonstrations offer a scalable data
source for learning bimanual manipulation. Prior works lever-
age large-scale human videos [ 18 , 42 , 3 ] or utilize wearable
devices for scalable data collection [ 16 , 24 , 49 , 14 , 25 ].
However, they still require co-training or fine-tuning with robot
teleoperation data due to the large human-to-robot embodiment
gap. In addition to learning bimanual manipulation, recent
works further leverage egocentric demonstrations to learn
active perception behaviors [ 36 , 45 , 43 , 8 ]. However, these
approaches assume a robot with a customized 6-DoF neck to
directly mimic human head motions, bypassing the kinematic
and action-space gaps between human and robot heads. On the
contrary, we leverage a 3D visual representation and a look-at
point action abstraction to transfer active perception behaviors
from human demonstrations to a standard bimanual mobile
manipulator with only a 2-DoF neck.

C. Learning Mobile Manipulation From Demonstrations
Mobile manipulation couples long-range navigation with
precise manipulation, making it challenging to learn from
human demonstrations. While learning decoupled navigation-
manipulation strategies [ 35 , 31 , 41 ] simplifies the problem,
these methods limit the ability to imitate end-to-end behav-
iors directly from human demonstrations. Recent works learn
policies that predict end-effector commands, employing a
whole-body controller to realize them through coordinated mo-
tion [ 12 , 30 ]. While effective, these pipelines have primarily
been demonstrated on single-arm platforms.
Scaling to the bimanual setting introduces distinct chal-
lenges, where two-arm coordination, base positioning, and
active perception must be synchronized. Although low-cost
whole-body interfaces [ 10 , 9 , 15 ] attempt to ease the col-
lection of such coordinated bimanual demonstrations, their
dependence on robot teleoperation creates a bottleneck for

data scalability. Alternative approaches explore in-the-wild
data collection with wearable devices [ 49 ], learning from
human videos [ 1 ], or automated data generation through
simulation [ 19 ], yet these methods still require robot teleoper-
ation data for fine-tuning. In contrast, HoMMI allows mobile
manipulation directly from robot-free human demonstrations.

III. D ESIGN O BJECTIVES
The goal of this paper is to design a general learning from
demonstration framework for whole-body mobile manipula-
tion for diverse manipulation tasks. To meet this requirement,
we target the following system capabilities:

• Scalability : fast, intuitive, and portable demonstration inter-
face for data collection in diverse environments.

• Transferability : overcoming both visual and kinematic em-
bodiment gaps from human demonstrators to robots.

• Whole-body coordination : able to efficiently coordinate
whole-body action to realize both precise end-effector track-
ing for accurate manipulation and effective active perception
to intentionally gather task-relevant information.
Fig. 2 shows an overview of our system. We achieve
scalability through an intuitive data collection interface (§ IV ),
transferability through a cross-embodiment hand-eye policy
trained on the collected demonstrations (§ V ), and whole-body
motion through a whole-body controller (§ VI-B ) that executes
policy outputs under the robot’s physical constraints.

IV. H O MMI D ATA C OLLECTION I NTERFACE
To enable scalable, robot-free demonstration data collection
for bimanual mobile manipulation, we adapt the UMI gripper
design while extending it with an egocentric view and head
motion capture. Concretely, the data collection system uses
three iPhones: two mounted on the grippers and one mounted
on a cap (Fig. 2 left). We leverage Apple’s ARKit multi-device
collaboration to establish a shared coordinate frame across
phones. During each demonstration, we record RGB video,
depth maps, 6-DoF poses, and gripper widths at 60 Hz on all
three iPhones, producing synchronized multimodal trajectories
that are directly consumable by our downstream policy learn-
ing pipeline (§ V ). The interface is designed to be intuitive
and lightweight, providing direct visual and haptic feedback to

3D representation for egocentric observations that allows using an
embodiment-agnostic gripper coordinate frame, and masking out
embodiment-specific arms and body observations.

the operator and avoiding the motion-sickness often associated
with VR-based data collection [ 43 , 45 , 36 ].

V. C ROSS - EMBODIMENT H AND -E YE P OLICY
Leveraging the collected data, we train an end-to-end vi-
suomotor policy based on Diffusion Policy [ 2 , 6 ]. At each
time step t , the policy conditions on a short observation
window O t = o t − T o + 1 ,..., o t and predicts a horizon of actions
A t = a t + 1 ,..., a t + T p . However, naively adding the head RGB
image to the observation and directly predicting the head pose
as part of the action substantially enlarges the human-robot
embodiment gap, often leading to failures in deployment. We
therefore introduce three key algorithmic designs that over-
come these transferability challenges, including (1) a 3D visual
representation, (2) a 3D look-at point action representation,
and (3) a gripper-centric frame shared by observations and
actions. The center of Fig. 2 shows an overview of our policy.

A. 3D Visual Representation to Mitigate the Visual Gap
Head-mounted RGB cameras often exhibit larger viewpoint
and appearance differences between the human and robot
compared to wrist-mounted cameras. Consequently, instead of
directly feeding head RGB to the policy, we lift the egocentric
observations into 3D and encode them with geometry-aware

# Page 4
tokens, inspired by Adapt3R [ 33 ]. Specifically, for each head
camera frame, we first obtain a pointmap (from iPhone depth
or stereo depth estimation [ 32 ] on the robot), and patchify
and downsample it via nearest neighbor interpolation s.t.
each 16 × 16 patch corresponds to one 3D point. We then
process the RGB frame by extracting a DINO-v3 ViT patch
feature [ 27 , 37 ] for each patch. These patch features are further
lifted to 3D by concatenating them with a sinusoidal encoding
of the corresponding 3D point in the downsampled pointmap,
tying appearance feature to 3D geometry and making the
feature robust to head pose and height changes. To further
reduce the appearance mismatch, we mask out arm points
by transforming the pointmaps into left/right gripper frames
and discarding points with z < 0, since arms originate behind
the grippers. In the end, we use an attention pooling layer to
process all tokens and obtain a head observation embedding.
Fig. 3 illustrates the visual representation of our policy.
The entire observation embedding includes the 3D repre-
sentation mentioned above, a 2D representation for wrist
images, and proprioception. Concretely, we finetune a shared
dinov3-vitb16 encoder for wrist and head images. Wrist
images are resized to 224 × 224 and represented by the
CLS token features F wrist . The egocentric image is resized to
512 × 512, split into 32 × 32 = 1024 image patches, augmented
with 3D positional encoding, and downsampled to 512 tokens;
attention pooling (with the arm attention mask) yields F ego .

Fig. 4: Look-at Point Action Rep-
resentation. To bridge the kine-
matic gap (e.g., height and neck
DoF), we relax the head action
constraint by representing the robot
gaze as a “3D look-at point”. This
representation allows effective ac-
tive perception for gathering task-
relevant information without over-
constraining the robot to mimic hu-
man head motions exactly.

Mobile robots have dif-
ferent kinematics than hu-
man
demonstrators
(e.g.,
shorter torso and fewer de-
grees of freedom in the
neck).
As
a
result,
di-
rectly
mimicking
6-DoF
head poses from human
data can easily produce in-
feasible motions. We in-
stead control head motion
via a 3D look-at point ℓ t ∈
R 3 (Fig. 4 ). This relaxed
representation preserves ac-
tive perception intent while
respecting kinematic con-
straints (Fig. 5 a).
During
training,
the
look-at point is computed
as the intersection of the
center camera ray with the scene pointmap. At inference,
the head controller converts ℓ t to a feasible head orientation
by
constructing
a
rotation
whose
forward
axis
points
toward ℓ t . Let c t ∈ R 3 be the current head position and let
R cur


∈ R 3 × 3 be the current head orientation,
where x t denotes the current head x -axis. We define the
desired viewing direction as a unit vector pointing from the

current position to the look-at point, ˆ d t =
ℓ t − c t
∥ ℓ t − c t ∥ . We then
project the current x -axis onto the plane orthogonal to
ˆ d t ,
x ′
t = x t − ( x ⊤
t ˆ d t ) ˆ d t , ˆ x t =
x ′ t
∥ x ′ t ∥ , and construct the remaining axis
ˆ y t = ˆ d t × ˆ x t . The target head rotation is then R t =

ˆ x t
ˆ y t
ˆ d t

.
If ∥ x ′
t ∥ is near zero, we replace x t with a fixed world-up
vector before projection. This yields a feasible head command
without constraining the policy to robot-specific pose limits.

C. Gripper-Centric Frame for Spatial Awareness
In our system, hand-eye coordination requires a reference
frame that keeps observations and actions in-distribution.
Egocentric frames shift with head motion and embodiment
differences (height, neck DoF, camera placement), which hurts
transfer from human demonstration to robot. We therefore
express all observations and actions in a gripper-centric frame
by transforming gripper poses (both proprioception and ac-
tion), head pointmaps, and look-at points to the left-gripper
frame, so the policy always reasons in a consistent spatial
frame centered at the manipulator. This anchors observation
and action to the manipulators that execute the task, improving
spatial awareness for 3D representations and reducing cross-
embodiment mismatch compared to an egocentric frame that
drifts with out-of-distribution (OOD) head motion.

support

capture egocentric context. To align training and deployment
setup, we mount fin-ray fingers identical to the UMI grippers
on the end-effectors and mount wrist-mounted cameras
( FLIR BFS-PGE-50S5C-C ) at similar locations.

B. Constraint-Aware Whole-body Controller
Since our policy outputs end-effector poses and head look-at
points, we need a whole-body controller to solve whole-body
joint actions and base motions to achieve the cartesian space
end-effector trajectory commands. Specifically, the whole-
body controller needs to meet these requirements: accuracy

# Page 5
Fig. 5: HoMMI Whole-Body Controller is designed to achieve precise end-effector tracking for accurate manipulation and effective active
perception for information gathering. To do so, it uses (a) a relaxed head look-at point action representation that allows accurate bimanual
end-effectors SE(3) tracking, circumventing the infeasibility and increased error associated with simultaneous 6-DoF head-hand tracking. In
addition, we also apply (b) constraints and regularization to ensure stability and prevent the disastrous behaviors that would otherwise occur.

(low tracking error), smoothness (non-jerky motion), stability
(no falls or self-collisions), and human-likeness (similar range
of motion as the demonstrator).
To satisfy these requirements, we implement a differential
whole-body IK solver using Mink [ 44 ] with (i) high-weight
bimanual SE ( 3 ) tracking terms to prioritize accuracy, (ii)
temporal command interpolation combined with posture and
velocity regularization to encourage smooth motions, (iii)
explicit constraints and tasks such as torso upright orientation,
center-of-mass (CoM) support, and self-collision avoidance, to
ensure stability; and (iv) regularization toward a nominal “hu-
man” posture and a balanced allocation between arm motion
and base motion to produce human-like behavior (Fig. 5 b).
Concretely, let ∆ q ∈ R n v be the velocity DoFs, define
the objective function
f ( ∆ q ) = C ee ( ∆ q ) + C nominal ( ∆ q ) +
C current ( ∆ q )+ C com ( ∆ q ) . The costs include (1) C ee end-effector
pose tracking (primary task); (2) C nominal a nominal posture
task to bias toward a preset human-like configuration; (3)
C current a current posture task to discourage sudden posture
changes; and (4) C com a CoM-over-base task to keep the body
mass supported by the base. At each timestep, we solve for
∆ q using a constrained quadratic program,

min
∆ q ∈ R nv
f ( ∆ q )+ λ ∥ ∆ q ∥ 2

s.t.
G cfg ∆ q ≤ h cfg
G joint-vel ∆ q ≤ h joint-vel
G base-vel ∆ q ≤ h base-vel
G coll ∆ q ≤ h coll
A upright ∆ q = 0

where λ is the damping coefficient. The inequality constraints
G j ∆ q ≤ h j encode configuration bounds G cfg , joint velocity
bounds G joint-vel , base velocity bounds G base-vel , and colli-
sion avoidance limits G coll . Finally, the equality constraint
A upright ∆ q = 0 enforces a zero-sum constraint on the three
torso joints for an upright posture. Together, these tasks
and constraints balance accuracy, smoothness, stability, and
human-likeness in a single optimization.
We run this IK solver asynchronously at 100 Hz to bridge

the 10 Hz policy loop and the 500 Hz robot control loop.
The policy produces a stream of target end-effector poses
with specified command durations (0 . 1 s). At each IK tick,
we compute an interpolated target by linearly blending the
previous and current targets based on the elapsed fraction of
the command duration. This reduces discontinuities at policy
update boundaries and improves tracking smoothness.

C. Asynchronous Policy Inference

Mobile manipulation cannot be paused for inference without
introducing base jerks and tracking errors, so we decouple
perception, policy inference, and whole-body control. We run a
detached policy server that receives timestamped observations,
performs inference, and returns a timestamped action chunk;
and a real-time execution bridge that aligns observations across
sensors to prepare timestamped observations for the policy,
receives actions from the policy, filters stale actions, and
streams time-aligned targets to the whole-body controller.
At each inference cycle, the bridge collects a history of cam-
era frames and proprioception, corrects each camera stream by
a measured latency, and then uses the latest camera timestamp
as the anchor. Proprioception is interpolated to these anchor
timestamps. This yields a synchronized observation window ,
similar to the latency matching in UMI [ 5 ]. The policy server
takes in these observations, runs policy inference, and outputs
a horizon of actions whose timestamps are anchored to the
last observation time. The bridge then discards any actions
whose timestamps fall before the earliest feasible execution
time, given inference time and execution latency, and updates
the scheduled action buffer with the remaining actions. These
buffered actions are streamed at 10 Hz to provide latency-
matched targets to the whole-body controller.

VII. E VALUATION

We evaluate whether long-horizon bimanual mobile ma-
nipulation can be learned directly from robot-free human
demonstrations and transferred to a real mobile manipulator.
Specifically, our evaluation probes four core capabilities:

Fig. 8: Quantitative Results. Ours consistently outperforms base-
lines across all three long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks.

• Cross-embodiment transfer : deploying policies learned
from robot-free human demonstrations on a robot with a
different appearance and kinematics. Required for all tasks.

• Bimanual / Whole-body coordination : coordinating two
arms, mobile base, torso, and head for mobile manipulation.

• Long-horizon
navigation :
moving
through
a
large
workspace and approaching targets whose locations vary.

• Active perception : intentionally controlling head motion
to acquire task-relevant information that may initially be
outside the field of view.

We compare HoMMI to the following baselines and ablations:

• Wrist-Only(UMI) : the original UMI [ 5 , 12 ] setup, using
only wrist RGBs as input and gripper trajectories as output.

• RGB-Only(UMI+Ego) : naively adding head RGB to the
UMI design and predicting gripper and 6-DoF head actions
directly. This setup is similar to ViA [ 36 ], however, we
use a wearable UMI device for data collection instead of
teleoperating the same robot embodiment, which provides
better scalability but also introduces additional challenges
in cross-embodiment policy learning.

• Head-Only : removing wrist RGBs from Ours policy
observation and only using the 3D head observation.

• w/o Active Neck : running Ours policy but disabling
head motion control.

A. Laundry Task
Task: As shown in Fig. 7 a, the robot approaches a table, grasps
a cloth with both hands, searches for a bin, navigates, and
places the cloth in the bin. The task success rate is measured
by whether the cloth is placed in the bin in the end.
Capability: Bimanual coordination: The robot must grasp the
cloth firmly with both hands. Whole-body coordination: The
bin is placed to the side and lower than the table, thus
requiring the robot to flexibly coordinate whole-body motion
to navigate, rotate, and bend down to approach the bin and
place the cloth into it. Active perception: The bin may be
outside the camera view after grasping, thus requiring the robot
to actively search for it by looking sideways until it locates it.
Data Collection: We collected 200 demonstrations with ran-
domized bin locations, initial configurations, and objects.
Test Scenarios: As shown in Fig. 7 b, we ran evaluation across
a total of 20 rollouts, involving 5 objects (2 seen and 3 unseen)
and 4 bin configurations (2 on the left and 2 on the right).
Performance: Quantitative results are shown in Fig. 8 (left).
Ours achieves a 90% success rate. It flexibly coordinates
whole-body motion to navigate the workspace and place the
cloth in the bin, robustly searches the environment to find the
bin, and always turns correctly. Occasional failures result from
not grasping the cloth firmly enough, causing it to slip halfway.
Fig.
7 c
shows
the
baselines’
typical
failure
modes.
(1) Wrist-Only policy’s dominant failure is consistently
turning to one side, regardless of the bin location, due to
the bin not being visible from the wrist camera view. Other
failure cases include not grasping firmly enough and inac-
curately placing the cloth in the bin. We hypothesize that
these issues are due to the lack of global context and spatial
information from wrist views. (2) RGB-Only consistently
fails to grasp and presses the table too hard, triggering the
robot’s wrench safety guard, which we hypothesize is due to
egocentric RGB having appearance and viewpoint mismatches

in human and robot observations, causing the policy to go
OOD. (3) Head-Only ’s success rate is also 0%, failing due
to missing the cloth when attempting to grasp it, and only
grasping one edge which leads to slip off later. Compared
with Ours , this demonstrates that wrist cameras help provide
local contact information that can improve grasping accuracy.
(4) w/o Active Neck achieves a 75% success rate, mostly
failing to accurately place the cloth into the bin. We hypoth-
esize that the lack of active perception causes the view to be
more OOD and the bin to be not fully in view.

B. Delivery Task
Task: As shown in Fig. 9 a, the robot carries a box, searches
for a trolley, navigates over a large workspace, and places the
box onto the trolley. The task success rate is measured by
whether the box is eventually placed onto the trolley.
Capability: Bimanual coordination: Two hands need to main-
tain a stable distance to avoid crushing or tearing the box.
They also need to coordinate heights to lift the box up and
then lower it for accurate placement. Long-horizon navigation:
The robot needs to navigate a large workspace (6 × 6m)
and accurately approach the trolley in randomized locations.
Active perception: The trolley may initially be out of view
when the robot is rotated to face the other way, requiring the
robot to search for the trolley, rotate, and then navigate over.
Data Collection: We collected 166 demonstrations with vary-
ing trolley locations and initial standing locations.
Test Scenarios: As shown in Fig. 9 b, We conducted 20
rollouts in total, consisting of 5 trolley locations and 4 different
initial robot base initializations (position + yaw).
Performance: Quantitative results are shown in Fig. 8 (mid-
dle). Ours achieves 85% success. The policy robustly per-
forms visual servoing and long-horizon navigation, always
approaching the correct direction towards the trolley. It also
reactively adjusts the robot’s approaching direction midway if

scenarios with different initial base positions and mat placement. (c)

the initial alignment is inaccurate. The remaining failures are
due to slight misalignment at the end after long navigation.

Typical baseline failure modes are shown in Fig. 9 c.
(1) Wrist-Only achieves 15%, the policy frequently ap-
proaches from an incorrect side or misaligns during placement,
demonstrating that navigation and approach require global
context beyond wrist views. (2) RGB-Only achieves 45%.
The policy consistently fails to turn towards the trolley when
it is initially out of view because 6-DoF active head motion
commands are unachievable by the whole-body IK due to
kinematic infeasibility. (3) Head-Only achieves 5%, often
colliding the box with the trolley because the gripper heights
are too low. This highlights that egocentric context alone
is insufficient for manipulation precision. (4) w/o Neck
achieves 55%, often lifting the box too high during final
placement due to the lack of a look down head motion.

C. Tablescape Task
Task: As shown in Fig. 10 a, the robot approaches a table and
grasps the two edges of a mat, carefully lifts the mat up and
moves forward to unfold it, and finally lays the mat completely
flat on the table and retracts its hands.
Capability: Bimanual coordination : two hands need to pre-
cisely coordinate rotation and height to grasp the edges of
the mat, and consistently maintain a stable distance and
height to unfold it. Whole-body coordination : The robot needs
to coordinate the base, torso, and arm motions to navigate
across the workspace and significantly adjust the height of the
grippers throughout the task.
Data Collection: We collected 115 demonstrations with vary-
ing initial standing locations and mat placements on the table.
Test Scenarios: We ran 20 rollouts in total, including 5 initial
base initializations and 2 mat configurations, and tried twice
for each configuration (Fig. 10 b).
Performance: Quantitative results are shown in Fig. 8 (right).
Ours achieves an 80% success rate, demonstrating robust
recovery behaviors. When the mat is not perfectly aligned with
the table or folds back on the first attempt, the robot lifts the
mat again and retries until it successfully unfolds. Occasional
failure cases arise from slightly missing the grasp.
Fig. 10 c shows the failure modes of the baselines.
(1) Wrist-Only grippers rotate too late and go well above
the mat, which we hypothesize is due to the lack of global
spatial context. (2) RGB-Only presses the grippers too hard
against the table, potentially due to OOD head observations.
(3) Head-Only misses contact with the mat, demonstrating
the need for wrist cameras to provide local contact infor-
mation. (4) w/o Neck achieves 55% success, with failures
resulting from missing the grasp and failing to recover when
the mat folds back, potentially due to the inability to actively
adjust the viewpoint for better alignment observation.

D. Findings Summary

F1: Wrist-only sensing under-observes global task context
and bimanual coordination. Wrist-Only policy exhibits
poor performance on all tasks that require search, navigation,
and alignment, which depend on the wider scene. It is not
capable of actively searching for task-relevant context in the
scene due to its limited field of view. It is brittle in long-
horizon navigation, drifting easily and unable to recover from
failures due to the lack of global task progress. It also lacks
spatial awareness of the other hand, which causes failures in
coordinating both hands for precise bimanual manipulation.
On the contrary, HoMMI augments UMI with egocentric sens-
ing , providing global context and active perception behaviors
crucial for mobile manipulation.
F2: Head-mounted camera alone is insufficient. While
being the most common camera configuration for humanoid
design [ 4 , 23 , 11 ], the Head-Only baseline that relies solely
on a head-mounted camera fails in grasping and alignment.
HoMMI combines head camera views with wrist camera
views, which provide essential local contact cues for fine-
grained manipulation. We also find that having wrist visual

observations as policy input and jointly finetuning the vision
encoder on both wrist and egocentric images helps the policy
learn cleaner egocentric attention that is more focused on task-
relevant objects (Fig. 11 Ours v.s. Head-Only ).

F3: Naively adding egocentric RGB can degrade per-
formance under embodiment mismatch. Directly feeding
the head RGB to the policy and regressing the head motion
leads to brittle grasping and unstable motions, yielding a 0%
success rate on two tasks, indicating a significant OOD shift
due to viewpoint/appearance mismatch. Tracking 6-DoF head
and hand trajectories together often leads to large tracking
errors and violates the robot’s kinematic constraints (Fig. 5 ).
HoMMI bridges the visual gap by leveraging an embodiment-
agnostic 3D egocentric visual representation, and bridges the
kinematic gap through a relaxed 3D look-at point head action
representation that allows the whole-body controller to achieve
precise end-effector tracking and effective active perception.

F4: Active head control effectively gathers task-relevant
information and maintains policy observability. Disabling
head motion reduces success, particularly when it is required
to actively search for the object and precisely place or align
objects. This supports that our look-at point based active head
control effectively imitates human’s active perception behavior
to gather task-relevant information and aligns the egocentric
view more closely with the training distribution.

F5: Our cross-embodiment hand-eye policy learns task-
relevant attention. As shown in Fig. 11 , Ours yields ego-
centric attention maps highlighted on task-relevant objects and
contacts, demonstrating the effectiveness of our observation
representation and gripper coordinate frame design. This also
potentially helps to mitigate the visual embodiment gap, as
the policy attends more to task-relevant regions than OOD
observation points.
